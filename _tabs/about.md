Hello! I'm Dat2Phit, a final-year IT student at HCMUS, majoring in Software Engineering — though I'm way more into web security. I'm also the president of the [Computer Security Club - University of Science, VNU-HCM](https://www.facebook.com/hcmus.compsec.club).

My main focus is **web exploitation**. I actively participate in CTF competitions with [DeadSec](https://deadsec.team/) and my club’s team, [blackpinker](https://ctftime.org/team/155048).

I primarily train on DreamHack, the challenges there are super fun and creative. You can check out my profile [here](https://dreamhack.io/users/30626).

Right now, I’m part of Unit 515 at [OPSWAT](https://www.opswat.com/), a team of researchers and pentesters.
